Everything is cube-shaped here: the trees, the houses and even the inhabitants. According to these human-like creatures, they have been attacked by undeads a few days ago. Did Horzine's scientists send them here as well? Since our nightmare has now become theirs, we have to help these cube-shaped guys to survive.",FallbackName="ZedCraft")
